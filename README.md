# About the project

The weather app is a microverse project in which you have to work with the Single Responsibility Principle, as well as with Loose Coupled Objects. The project has different options, you can add new projects to work with, and you can also add, change, and delete To do's.  I always like to add a little of whimsical touch to the projects, that's why there is a Pink Panther photo (if you remember the theme song of Pink Panther, you will understand why).  You can see the project specifications [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).
